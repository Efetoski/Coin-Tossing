# Coin-Tossing
Write a program to toss a coin.
First plan out how you will store and manipulate your data.
1. Create a program to toss a coin 100 times, recording whether it lands heads or tails
as “H” or “T” in a data list. Print your list in 5 rows of 20.
2. Now modify your program to find the longest continuous run of heads and the
longest continuous run of tails.
3. Now modify your program to count how many times three heads were tossed in a
row and output your result.
